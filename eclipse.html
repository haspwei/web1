                <p>In Seattle, Washington, the vampire Victoria Sutherland attacks the human Riley Biers, turning him into a vampire. Thus she begins creating an army of newborn vampires to help her get revenge on Edward Cullen, who killed her lover James Witherdale.
                    In Forks, Edward and his human girlfriend Bella Swan discuss her desire to be turned into a vampire, but Edward wants her to stay human. He asks her to marry him, but she is reluctant, even after Edward promises to turn her into a vampire if she agrees. Bella talks with her father, Charlie, who decides to lift Bellaâ€™s house arrest if she promises to spend more time with her other friends and Jacob Black, her childhood friend and a werewolf with a strong dislike for vampires and Edward.
                    Edward's clairvoyant sister, Alice Cullen, foresees the newborn vampire army, led by Riley, attacking Forks. Edward's family chase Victoria through the forest, but she escapes into werewolf territory, causing an incident between the vampires and the werewolves that flares up tensions between them. Edward decides to keep all this a secret from Bella.
                    At school, Edward and Jacob have a tense meeting, where Jacob reveals the incident to Bella. She is annoyed with Edward keeping things from her, so decides to leave with Jacob, and starts spending more time with him and his tribe. Eventually Jacob confesses his love to her. She tells him she's in love with Edward, but he refuses to believe it, and kisses her. She angrily punches him, but hurts her hand on his hard werewolf body. Later, Jacob apologizes for his behavior, and Bella forgives him.
                    The Cullens forge an uneasy alliance with the werewolf tribe to defend against Victoria's oncoming attack, and train together. During the training, Alice's partner, Jasper Hale, tells Bella that he was once part of a newborn army and hated himself, but eventually experienced happiness once he fell in love with Alice.
                    Bella and Edward spend the night alone in his family home and, afraid how her feelings will change after being turned into a vampire, she agrees to marry him if he agrees to have sex with her. The two make out, but Edward finds it too dangerous, and explains that he wants to wait until marriage, after which he shows Bella his mother's ring and asks her to marry him, and she says yes.
                    They use Bella's blood to bait the newborn vampire army, and Edward and Bella camp in the mountains away from the fight to keep her safe. They discuss their engagement, which Jacob overhears, after which he storms off. Bella chases Jacob and desperately asks him to kiss her, which they do. Bella explains to Edward that although she loves Jacob, her love for Edward is stronger.
                    They get interrupted when Victoria and her army attack. The Cullen family together with the werewolves manage to fend off the attack, with Edward killing Victoria, but Jacob gets badly injured during the fight. After the werewolves carry Jacob to safety, the Volturi guard, who carry out vampire laws, arrive and find the Cullens guarding Bree Tanner one of the newborns whom Victoria created, surrendered.
                    The Volturi torture and interrogate Bree, despite the Cullens' protests. When the Volturi note that Bella is still human, against their agreement, she explains the date for her transformation has been set. The leader of the Volturi guard sends one of her subordinates to kill Bree, with the Cullens too afraid to intervene. Afterwards, Bella visits the injured Jacob to tell him she has chosen to be with Edward, and he reluctantly accepts her decision.
                    Bella and Edward talk about their upcoming wedding in their meadow. Edward questions why she is doing this, and Bella explains that she feels more herself in Edward's world and wants to be connected to him, and they decide to reveal their engagement to Bella's father.</p>
